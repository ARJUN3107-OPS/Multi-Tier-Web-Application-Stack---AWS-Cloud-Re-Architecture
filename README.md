
 VPROFILE Multi-Tier Web Application Re-Architecture on AWS

This project demonstrates the re-architecture of a multi-tier web application on the AWS cloud, focusing on flexibility, cost reduction, and improved operational efficiency.  The existing infrastructure, comprised of physical, virtual, and cloud machines, was migrated to a fully managed AWS environment leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) principles.

 Project Goals

 Flexibility: Build a highly adaptable and scalable infrastructure.
 Cost Optimization: Eliminate upfront capital expenditure and optimize operational expenditure.
 Automation: Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate deployments and management.
 Scalability & Uptime: Improve application scalability and ensure high availability.
 Agility: Enhance development and deployment agility.

 Architecture Overview

The re-architected application utilizes the following AWS services:

 Compute: EC2 (Virtual Machines for Tomcat Application Server), Elastic Beanstalk (Application hosting and management), Auto Scaling (Automating VM scaling)
 Storage: S3 (Object Storage), EFS (Elastic File System)
 Database: RDS (Relational Database Service - MySQL), Elastic Cache (Memcached for in-memory caching)
 Message Broker: Active MQ
 Networking: Route 53 (DNS), CloudFront (CDN - Content Delivery Network)
 Load Balancing: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) / NGINX (within Beanstalk)

 Deployment Steps

1. Initial Setup:
     Log in to your AWS account.
     Create a key pair for EC2 instance access.
     Create security groups for:
         Elastic Cache
         RDS
         Active MQ

2. Database Initialization:
     Launch an EC2 instance (or use a more automated approach like a Lambda function).
     Connect to the instance and initialize the RDS database schema.

3. Elastic Beanstalk Configuration:
     Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment (e.g., Tomcat).
     Configure security groups to allow traffic:
         From the load balancer to the EC2 instances within Beanstalk.
         Between backend services within the same security group.

4. Load Balancer and Health Checks:
     Configure the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) within Elastic Beanstalk.
     Set the health check path (e.g., `/login`).
     Configure HTTPS listener on port 443 with an SSL certificate.

5. Build and Deploy Application Artifact:
     Build the application artifact (e.g., WAR file).
     Deploy the artifact to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

6. CDN and DNS Configuration:
     Create a CloudFront distribution.
     Configure the distribution with an SSL certificate.
     Update DNS records in GoDaddy (or your DNS provider) to point to the CloudFront distribution's domain name.

7. Testing:
     Thoroughly test the application through the CloudFront URL.
